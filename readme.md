SystemInspect is a program written in python, and a bit of powershell that provides information about a computer system. The program utilizes several functions to retrieve information about the computer's BIOS, CPU, hard disks, motherboard, and RAM. This information is presented in a notebook interface with a tab for each category.

The goal of SystemInspect is to provide users with an easy way to view important information about their computer system. The program is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to users of all technical backgrounds.

more functionality will be added in future releases.
